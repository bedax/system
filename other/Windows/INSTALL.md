_These are some notes on how to install the author's system. These aren't expected to be useful to anyone else._


# Install

- 7zip
- [chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/)
- [ext2read](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/)
- git
- [internet explorer 11 down to 6](https://www.windows10download.com/utilu-ie-collection/)
- keepassx
- link shell extension
- malwarebytes
- meld
- geany
- wincdemu


## mingw and unxutils

Copy unxutils to `C:\Program Files (x86)\unxutils`.

Add the above paths to the PATH, with unxutils at the bottom of the list so it has the least priority. Move git's paths to the top of the system's PATH, so its `find` command overrides Windows'.


## Pins

- chromium
- geany
- explorer
- keepassx
